# StickyRice

StickyRice is a Wordpress starter kit by Fat Pixel.

And it's heavily under construction right now :)

## Styling and assets

This starter kit assumes that you'll use stylesheets, javascript and other assets like in the (https://github.com/jolantis/altair)[Altair] starterkit.

Classes on HTML elements are all in BEM notation.

## Header and footer

This starter kit assumes you'll be using some sort of critical css and an asynchronous style and script loader like (https://github.com/filamentgroup/enhance)[Enhance]. The header.php and footer.php reflect that. If you're planning to use regular ``<link>`` and ``<script>`` tags loading these assets, feel free to do so!

## Thanks

A lot of inspiration for this starterkit is coming from the great (http://themble.com/bones/)[Bones theme], developed by Eddie Machado.

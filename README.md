# StickyRice

StickyRice is a Wordpress starter kit by Fat Pixel.

And it's heavily under construction right now :)

## Styling and assets

This starter kit assumes that you'll use stylesheets, javascript and other assets like in the (https://github.com/jolantis/altair)[Altair] starterkit.

Classes on HTML elements are all in BEM notation.

## Thanks

A lot of inspiration for this starterkit is coming from the great (http://themble.com/bones/)[Bones theme], developed by Eddie Machado.
